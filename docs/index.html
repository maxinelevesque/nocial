      <h1 id="tufte-css">Get off social media.</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">You can't fight if your mind is paralyzed.</p>

      <section>
        <p>Since the widespread adoption of social media began in earnest around twenty years ago, the amount of information that we are exposed to every day has exploded. Over the next four-plus years, that process will accelerate dramatically.</p>

        <p>Ingesting this amount of information <em>hurts</em> us. We feel this every day—even if it's difficult to say so out loud, to ourselves or to others.</p>
        
        <p>The reason for this pain is simple:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Humans are not set up to handle this amount of information.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Our biology, psychology, and sociology developed over the course of many thousands of years to be finely tuned to entirely different conditions. As has happened with our food, our built environment, our work schedule, and so many other aspects of our daily lives, the explosive pace of change in our <em>ways of communicating</em> with each other has led us, bit by bit, to a place that is deeply unhealthy to our bodies and minds.</p>

        <p>Being inundated with so much information causes us to be unable to make sense of the world around us, or how we fit into it. The flood overwhelms our ability to think. It <em>paralyzes our minds</em>. It forces us to constantly retreat to strategies that our bodies developed to be reserved only for emergencies, and this fundamentally changes who we are.</p>

        <p>Worse, this entire scenario is <em>intentionally engineered</em> to work this way—and to be so addictive that it's incredibly painful to quit, even as the individual and collective harms multiply. We are made to feel that the benefits of staying hooked—and the costs of quitting the habit—are much larger than they are, not because our use is good for <em>us</em>, but because it is good for <em>certain people</em>.</p>
        
        <p>Terrifyingly, as the pace of change intensifies—as the volume of information we consume continues to rapidly expand—these problems will only get <em>worse</em>.</p>

        <p>And scariest of all: as technological acceleration progresses, even the folks who designed these systems for their own gain will <em>lose control</em> of how they evolve. The designers of nuclear weapons at the very least had a mathematical theory of the physical forces they played with, to bound the possibility of the very worst outcomes for humanity; such knowledge of the <em>sociological</em> forces underlying social media is beyond even today's most advanced understanding.</p>

        <p>With so many emerging crises coming to a head in our present and in the immediate future, there are many things that we need to do collectively to meet this unprecedented moment. But one thing is for certain:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>We cannot do anything at all if we become paralyzed by the information overload coming over the horizon.</p>
        </blockquote> </p>
        
        <p>The first and most foundational remedy is hard, but simple:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>We have to get off social media, so that we can act in the real world.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p style="text-align: center;">▽</p>

        <p>The good news is, <em>we can do it!</em> As with any habit, change is difficult, but doable.</p>

        <p>Some quick ways you can get started:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><em>Check in on your app usage once a month.</em> (Links for each platform.) Which apps take up the most time from your day? Which apps bring you real joy? Which apps suck you into a rabbit hole you have a hard time getting out of?</li>
          <li><em>Set daily time limits</em> for apps that are taking your time without giving you real joy. (Links for each platform.)</li>
          <li><em>Put up bigger barriers</em> for the most troublesome apps. Remove them from your home screen. Hide them behind a password or biometric ID (Links). Delete them from your devices entirely, to force you to use the lame browser interface. The harder it is to open the apps, the less you'll use them.</li>
          <li><em>Set a schedule for when apps are off-limits entirely</em>, to build a less reflexive and more intentional kind of relationship with them. Schedule a time in the morning or afternoon for doing a brief, time-limited app check-in; then, set up your focus states to block apps during the rest of your day. (Link.)</li>
          <li><em>Build other habits instead</em>—activities that really add to your life. Schedule more chunks of in-person time over coffee with friends in advance. Carry a book or a journal for when there's unplanned downtime. Find a meditation practice that feels good for you. (Link.) Take a walk to browse at a record store nearby. Over time, the reflex to check the apps gets weaker and weaker.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When trying these or other changes, it can help to be sure that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Each step you try is one that you think is a <em>stretch</em>, but <em>doable</em>.</li>
          <li>You <em>reward</em> yourself for little milestones—like grabbing a bag of gummy worms for a week of keeping to a change.</li>
          <li>If and when you end up back on an app when you didn't want to— give yourself <em>grace</em>, and try another strategy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="text-align: center;">▽</p>

        <p>In mental healthcare, "problematic use" of a substance has the following characteristic signs:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Using <em>the substance</em> in larger amounts or more often than you mean to.</li>
          <li>Wanting to cut down or stop using <em>the substance</em> but not managing to.</li>
          <li>Spending a lot of time getting, using, or recovering from use of <em>the substance</em>.</li>
          <li>Cravings and urges to use <em>the substance</em>.</li>
          <li>Not managing to do what you should at work, home, or school because of using <em>the substance</em>.</li>
          <li>Continuing to use <em>the substance</em>, even when it causes problems in relationships.</li>
          <li>Giving up important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of using <em>the substance</em>.</li>
          <li>Using <em>the substance</em> again and again, even when it harms you or puts you in danger.</li>
          <li>Continuing to use <em>the substance</em>, even when you know you have another physical or psychological problem (like anxiety or depression) that could have been caused or made worse by it.</li>
          <li>Needing more of <em>the substance</em>, or a more potent version of it, to get the effect you want.</li>
          <li>Development of withdrawal symptoms, which can be relieved by taking more of <em>the substance</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Replace <em>the substance</em> with your social media apps. How many of those statements apply to you? Two? Three? Five? More?</p>

        <p>Let's stop letting these apps control our lives and tell us who we are. Instead, let's connect with the people, places, activities, and spiritual practices that make us more of who we want to become.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">Let's get back to the real world together!</p>
