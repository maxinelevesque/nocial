      <p class="subtitle">You can't fight if your mind is paralyzed</p>

      <section>
        <p>Since the introduction of social media around twenty years ago, the amount of information that we are exposed to every day has exploded. Over the next four-plus years, that process will accelerate dramatically.</p>

        <p>Ingesting this amount of information <em>hurts</em> us. We feel this every day, even if it's difficult to say to ourselves or others.</p>
        
        <p>The reason is simple: <em>humans are not set up to handle this well</em>. Our biology, psychology, and sociology developed over the course of many thousands of years to be well-suited to entirely different conditions. Being inundated with so much information causes us to be unable to make sense of the world around us and how we fit into it. The flood overwhelms our ability to think, and so paralyzes our minds. Worse, this entire scenario is <em>intentionally engineered</em> to work this way—and to be so addictive that it's impossible to quit, even as the individual and collective harms get worse and worse.</p>
        
        <p>Terrifyingly, as the pace of change intensifies—as the volume of information we consume continues to rapidly expand—these problems will only get <em>worse</em>.</p>
